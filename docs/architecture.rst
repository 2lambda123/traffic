Architecture
============

- ``traffic.algorithms`` provides basic tools for working with trajectories (Douglas-Peucker, etc.)
- ``traffic.core`` provides basic structures for flights, set of flights (traffic) and sectors;
- ``traffic.data`` gives access to many sources of data. It includes basic information about European FIRs, aircraft (from `junzis <https://junzisun.com/adb/>`_), airports, airways and navaids. It also provides an interface to data from the `OpenSky Network <https://opensky-network.org>`_ and Eurocontrol DDR files.
- ``traffic.drawing`` offers static and dynamic output for Matplotlib, Google Earth (kmz) and CesiumJS (czml)
