Core structure
==============

The `traffic` library is based on three main core classes for handling:

- aircraft trajectories with `Flight <traffic.core.flight.html>`_
- collection of aircraft trajectories with `Traffic <traffic.core.traffic.html>`_
- airspaces and sectors with `Airspace <traffic.core.airspace.html>`_
